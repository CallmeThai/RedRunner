###### Die and retry, action, plateformer game.

###### You're a little red monster.
###### In order to finish the game you'll have to collect all the chests in all the levels.
###### To complete a level at 100% and get 3 stars, you'll have to: collect all the stars, reach the chest at the end and complete it without dying.
###### If you die to much, it's a game over, and you'll have to restart everything !
